I really don't expect anyone to use this but if you want to see some of my configs for popular cli tools that I use here you go.

As of now I am using GNU stow to add symbolic links to my git directory here that map to my actual .config directory. 

Since I have multiple machines I want my setup to be used on it's way easier to store my configs in this way to standardize them.
